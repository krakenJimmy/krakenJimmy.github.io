title: How to change your ubuntu theme
---

To be able to change your ubuntu theme, you'll need to isntall `Tweaks`.

In Debian and Ubuntu(18.04 or newer), install Tweaks by using the following command:

`sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks`

For older Debian and Ubuntu versions, install GNOME Tweaks Tool using the command below:

`sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool`

To be able to change the GNOME Shell theme, you'll need the User Theme GNOME Shell extension.

`sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extension`

You can download a theme from here [https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1252100/](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1252100/) and then unzip the file and place it in your themes directory `~/.themes/` or `/usr/share/themes`, then use `tweak` select the theme you want to use.

`communitheme` is the theme that I like more, you can install it use command `sudo snap install communitheme`
